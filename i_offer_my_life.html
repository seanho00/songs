<h1><a href="http://songs.seanho.com/i_offer_my_life.html"> I Offer My Life
</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p> All that I am, all that I have
<p>I lay them down before you, oh Lord
<p>All my regrets, all my acclaim
<p>The joy and the pain, I'm making them yours
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p>Lord, I offer my life to you,
<p>everything I've been through
<p>Use it for your glory
<p>Lord I offer my days to you,
<p>Lifting my praise to you
<p>As a pleasing sacrifice,
Lord I offer you my life
</blockquote></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Things in the past, things yet unseen
<br>Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
<br>All of my heart, all of my praise
<br>My heart and my hands are lifted to you
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bridge"><blockquote>
<p>What can we give
that you have not given?
<br>And what do we have
that is not already yours?
<br>All we possess
are these lives we're living
<br>That's what we give to you, Lord
</blockquote></div>
