<h1>Give It Away </h1>

<p>Well <i>C</i>if you try to hide God's love
<P>And <i>C</i>if you keep it all wrapped up
<p>Then <i>F</i>soon your love will start to fade
<p>`Cause <i>C</i>it was meant to give away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><chorus>
<p>You've got to <i>G</i>give -- <em>(give it, give it)</em>
<P>Ya gotta give it a<i>C</i>way -- <em>(give it, give it away)</em>
<p>You've got to <i>G</i>give -- <em>(give it, give it)</em>
<p>Ya gotta give it a<i>C</i>way -- <em>(give it, give it away)</em>
<p>'Cause you can't <i>F</i>hide -- <em>(shoo be doo wop, shoo be doo)</em>
<p>God's love ins<i>C</i>ide -- <em>(shoo be doo wop, shoo be doo wop)</em>
<p>You've got to <i>G</i>give (give it!) -- yeah!
<p>Give it a<i>C</i>way</p>
</blockquote></chorus>

<p>Well when I really stop and see
<br>All that he has given me
<br>His love just bubbles up inside
<br>And that is something I can't hide </p>

<p>Right side up or upside down
<br>We're gonna spread God's love around
<br>It doesn't matter where you live
<br>There's always something you can give </p>
