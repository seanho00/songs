<h1>I Adore You</h1>

<p>Disappointment cuts me like a knife 
<br>But I won't be afraid, no
<br>Strange operations happen all around
<br>The audience escapes unscathed
<br>You are my fortress in this storm
<br>I will cling to You like a sailor lost to the wind
<br>It's all about turns, turn about face
<br>It's all about knowing more of Your grace
<br>I know now
<br>You are my sure thing

<p>You know my heart, You know my soul
<br>You know my comings and goings, You know it all 
<br>And I adore You
<br>There are questions, there's no doubt
<br>I trust You and that matters now
<br>I, oh I adore You, yeah

<p>To the prisoner inside This mind of mine You know
<br>I only know so much
<br>Still You and You Alone have shown
<br>The lighthouse glow that leads me home again
<br>'Cause You are my sure thing

<p>I will wait for You 
<br>Every moment of this life 
<br>Journey closer to be refined 
<br>I will trust in You
<br>Far beyond this line of sight
<br>Journey closer to be my guide

This song was written after something very disappointing happened. I was left questioning why. I was hurt and confused but nobody knew except God and me. And most times, he's the only audience that I need.
<br>
"Pour out your hearts to God and trust in Him My salvation and my honor depend on God. He is my mighty rock and my refuge. Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to him for God is our refuge." Ps 62:7 and 8
<br>
Often times when tough questions arise, you want to run to someone else to ask their advice or opinion for an interpretation of what's going on. But, the Lord says "trust in me and pour your hearts out to me". There are questions and there's no doubt about that. But, trusting in the Lord is what matters.
