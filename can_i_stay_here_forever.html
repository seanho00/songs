<p><i>[capo 3]</i>&nbsp;</p>

<verse>
<p>Through for<i>D</i>gotten convictions and <i>Bm7</i>misplaced affections,
<p>I'm <i>Asus</i>losing the sound of Your <i>Gmaj7</i>voice
<p>I've been <i>D</i>chasing after emptiness,
   <i>Bm7</i>tryin' to tidy up this mess,
<p>I <i>Asus</i>swear I've been down this road be<i>G</i>fore
<p>I wanna <i>Gm</i>get back to where it all be<i>D/B</i>gan,
   when I would <i>C2</i>long for only <i>C2/Bb Asus</i>You 
</verse>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<chorus><blockquote>
<p><i>D</i>Like a child I'll <i>A/C#</i>take You at Your <i>G</i>word,
<p>As these mountains of <i>Gm</i>doubt, they fade a<i>D/B</i>way,
<p>I'm longing to <i>Asus</i>trust and love You <i>G6</i>more
<p><i>D</i>So for me this is <i>A/C#</i>beautiful,
<p><i>G</i>A brand new thought and a <i>Gm</i>brand new world,
<p><i>D/B</i>Can I stay here for<i>Asus</i>ever here with <i>G6</i>You?
</blockquote></chorus>

<verse>
<p>I've lost sight of what first drew me,
    to the love that pursued me,
<br>The joy that inspired my song
<br>The friendship that was all I knew,
    the arms that I would fall into
<br>Seem miles and years from where I am today
<br>I've gotta get back to where it all began,
    when I would long for only You
</verse>

<p>Can I <i>D</i>stay here forever, <i>A/C#</i>here with You?
<p>Sur<i>D/B</i>rounded by Your mercy, <i>Asus</i>clothed in Your truth
<p>Al<i>G</i>ways, I'll <i>A</i>stay,
   al<i>D/B</i>ways, here with <i>A/C#</i>You
<p>Can I <i>D</i>be here forever, <i>A/C#</i>here with You?
<p>Can I <i>D/B</i>know what it's like to <i>Asus</i>deeply love You
<p>Al<i>G</i>ways, Lord, let me <i>A</i>stay,
   al<i>D/B</i>ways, here with <i>A/C#</i>You
