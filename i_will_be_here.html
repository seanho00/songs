<h1>I Will Be Here</h1>

<p>
Tomorrow morning if you wake up, and the sun does not appear,
I, I will be here
If in the dark we lose sight of love, hold my hand and have no fear,
'Cause I will be here

I will be here when you feel like being quiet
When you need to speak your mind I will listen
And I will be here when the laughter turns to crying
Through the winnin', losin', and trying, we'll be together
'Cause I will be here

Tomorrow morning if you wake up and the future is unclear
I, I will be here
As sure as seasons are made for change our lifetimes are made for years
So I, I will be here

I will be here and you can cry on my shoulder
When the mirror tells us we're older
I will hold you
And I will be here to watch you grow in beauty 
And tell you all the things you are to me
I will be here, mmm

I will be true to the promise I have made
to you and to the One who gave you to me

[instrumental verse]
I , I will be here

And just as sure as seasons are made for change 
Our lifetimes are made for years, 
So I, I will be here, we'll be together, 
I will be here
