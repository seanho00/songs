<div class="verse">
<p>The <i>Em7</i>skies don't seem to be as dark as <i>C</i>usual;
<p>The <i>Em7</i>stars seem brighter than they've been be<i>C</i>fore;
<p><i>Em7</i>Deep within, I feel my soul is <i>C</i>stirring,
<p>As <i>Am7</i>though my hope has <i>C</i>been restored.
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p>The shepherds say they've heard the voice of angels
<br>Confirming rumors spread across the land:
<br>That a child protected well from Herod's anger
<br>Is our Father's Son, and the Son of Man.
</div>

<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p>Love is <i>Em7</i>raining down on the <i>C</i>world tonight;
<p>There's a <i>Em7</i>presence here I can <i>C</i>tell;
<p>God is <i>Em7</i>in us, God is <i>C</i>for us,
   God is <i>Am7</i>with us, Emmanu<i>G</i>el.
<p>He's the <i>Em7</i>Savior we have been <i>C</i>praying for
<p>In our <i>Em7</i>humble hearts he will <i>C</i>dwell:
<p>God is <i>Em7</i>in us, God is <i>C</i>for us,
   God is <i>Am7</i>with us, Emmanu<i>G</i>el.
</blockquote></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>I feel compelled to tell all who will listen
<br>That peace on earth is not so out of reach
<br>If we can find grace and mercy and forgiveness:
<br>He has come to save; He is all of these.
</div>
