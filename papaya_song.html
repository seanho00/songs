<small><font size="-4">
[ fill: E A  C#m B ]<br>
[ usually played as key of D relative to capo 2 ]
</font></small>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like ba<i>E</i>nanas,
<p>I know that mangos are sweet,
<p>I like pa<i>C#m</i>payas <em>(PAPAYAS?!)</em>,
<p>But nothing can beat,
<p>The <i>A</i>sweet <i>B</i>love of God!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was <i>E</i>walking round in circles five miles an hour
<p><i>C#m</i>Tryin' to find my way back to my Heavenly Father
<p>The <i>A</i>world tasted sweet, 
<p>But then it turned sour,
<p>Then I <i>B</i>asked Him in and received His power...
<p><em>1! 2! 3!</em>
