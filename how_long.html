<h1><a href="http://songs.seanho.com/"> How Long
</a></h1>

<div class="verse">
<p> We have <i>Am</i>sung our songs of <i>F</i>victory,
    we have <i>C/Em</i>prayed to You for <i>F</i>rain;
<p> We have <i>Dm</i>cried for Your com<i>G/Bm</i>passion
    to re<i>C/Em</i>new the land a<i>F</i>gain.
<p> Now we're <i>Am</i>standing in Your <i>F</i>presence,
    more <i>C/Em</i>hungry than be<i>F</i>fore;
<p> Now we're <i>Dm</i>on Your steps of <i>G/Bm</i>mercy,
    and we're <i>C/Em</i>knocking at Your <i>F</i>door
</div>

<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p> How <i>C</i>long, before You <i>F/C</i>drench the barren <i>C</i>land
<p> How <i>G/Bm</i>long, before we <i>Dm</i>see a righteous <i>Am</i>man
<p> <i>G</i>How <i>C</i>long, before Your <i>F/C</i>Name is lifted <i>C</i>high
<p> How <i>G/Bm</i>long, before the <i>Dm</i>weeping turns to
    <i>Am</i>songs <i>G</i>of <i>C</i>joy
</blockquote></div>

<div class="verse">
<p> Lord, we know Your heart is broken
    by the evil that You see,
<br>And You've stayed Your hand of judgment
    for your plan to set men free;
<br>But the land is still in darkness,
    and we've fled from what is right,
<br>And we've failed the silent children
    who will never see the light
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p> But I know a day is coming
    when the deaf will hear His voice,
<br>When the blind will see the Savior,
    and the lame will leap for joy.
<br>When a widow finds a husband
    who will always love his bride,
<br>And the orphan finds a father
    who will never leave her side
</div>

<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p> How long, before Your glory lights the skies
<br>How long, before Your radiance lifts our eyes
<br>How long, before Your fragrance fills the air
<br>How long, before the earth resounds with songs of joy
</blockquote></div>
