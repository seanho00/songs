<h1>If We Are the Body </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's <i>C#m</i>crowded in worship to<i>A</i>day
<p>As she slips <i>F#m</i>in trying to <i>A</i>fade into the <i>B</i>faces
<p>The <i>C#m</i>girls teasing laughter 
   is <i>A</i>carrying farther than they <i>F#m</i>know
<p>Farther than they <i>A</i>know <i>B</i>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<chorus><blockquote>
<p>But if <i>E</i>we are the body,
   why aren't His <i>B</i>arms reaching?
<p>Why aren't His <i>C#m</i>hands healing?
   Why aren't His <i>A</i>words teaching?
<p>And if <i>E</i>we are the body,
   why aren't His <i>B</i>feet going?
<p>Why is His <i>C#m</i>love not showing <i>B</i>them there is a <i>A</i>way?
<p>There is a <i>C#m</i>way
</blockquote></chorus>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A traveler is far away from home
<br>He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
<br>The weight of their judgmental glances
<br>Tells him that his chances are better out on the road

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<bridge><blockquote>
<p><i>B</i>Jesus paid <i>C#m</i>much too high a <i>A</i>price
<p>For us to pick and choose who should <i>B</i>come
<p>And we are the <i>C#m</i>body of <i>A</i>Christ
