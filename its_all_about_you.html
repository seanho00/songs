<h1>Jesus, Lover of My Soul (It's All About You)</h1>

<p>It's all about You, Jesus</p>
<p>And all this is for You</p>
<p>For Your glory and Your fame</p>
<p>It's not about me</p>
<p>As if You should do things my way</p>
<p>You alone are God and I surrender</p>
<p>To Your ways</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jesus, lover of my soul</p>
<p>All consuming fire is in Your gaze</p>
<p>Jesus, I want You to know</p>
<p>I will follow You all my days</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For no one else in history is like You</p>
<p>And history itself belongs to You</p>
<p>Alpha and Omega, You have loved me</p>
<p>And I will spend eternity with You</p>
