<p><i>[ capo 1 ]</i>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>In <i>G</i>Christ a<i>D</i>lone
   my <i>G</i>hope is <i>A</i>found,
   <i>D/F#m</i>He is my <i>G</i>light, <i>D/F#m</i>my <i>Em A</i>strength,
   my <i>D</i>song,
<p>This <i>G</i>Corner<i>D</i>stone,
   this <i>G</i>solid <i>A</i>Ground,
   <i>D/F#m</i>Firm through the <i>G</i>fier<i>D/F#m</i>cest <i>Em A</i>drought
   and <i>D</i>storm.
<p>What <i>D/F#m</i>heights of <i>G</i>love,
   what <i>D/F#m</i>depths of <i>A</i>peace,
   When <i>D/F#m</i>fears are <i>G</i>stilled,
   when <i>Bm7</i>strivings <i>A</i>cease!
<p>My <i>G</i>Comfor<i>D</i>ter,
   my <i>G</i>All <i>A</i>in All,
   <i>D/F#m</i>Here in the <i>G</i>love <i>D/F#m</i>of <i>Em A</i>Christ
   I <i>D</i>stand.

<verse>
<p>In Christ alone who took on flesh,
   Fullness of God in helpless babe!
<br>This gift of love and righteousness,
   Scorned by the ones He came to save.
<br>'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
   The wrath of God was satisfied -
<br>For every sin on Him was laid:
   Here in the death of Christ I live.
</verse>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>There in the ground His body lay,
   Light of the world by darkness slain,
<br>Then bursting forth in glorious day,
   Up from the grave He rose again!
<br>And as He stands in victory,
   Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
<br>For I am His and He is mine -
   Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
</verse>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>No guilt in life no fear in death,
   This is the power of Christ in me,
<br>From life's first cry to final breath,
   Jesus commands my destiny.
<br>No power of hell, no scheme of man,
   Can ever pluck me from His hand,
<br>'Til He returns or calls me home,
   Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!
</verse>
