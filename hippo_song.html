Hip Hip Hooray (The Hippo Song)
</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>In the beginning God made the seas
<p>And the forests, filled with trees;
<p>He built the mountains up so high;
<p>At the very top He placed the sky.
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>God's fingerprints are everywhere,
<p>Just to show how much He cares;
<p>In between He had loads of fun:
<p>He made the hippo that weighs a TON!
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p>Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus,
<p>Hip-hip-hooray!  God made all of us!
<p>Hip-hip-hip-hippopotamus,
<p>Hip-hip-hooray!  God made all of us!
</blockquote></div>

<!--
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Creation sings out His praise
<p>The sparrow and the tiny babe
<p>And we can sing and say, "WELL DONE!"
<p>Some things He just made for fun!
</div>
