<h1>I've Been Redeemed</h1>


<p>I've been redeemed, by the blood of the Lamb
<br>I've been redeemed, by the blood of the -- Laaaamb
<br>I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
<br>Saved and sanctified I am,
<br>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh you can't get to heaven, On roller skates
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven, On roller -- skaaaates
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven on roller skates
<br>You'd roll right by those Pearly Gates,
<br>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh you can't get to heaven, In a rocking chair
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven, In a rocking -- chaaaair
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven in a rocking chair
<br>'Cause a rocking chair won't get you there,
<br>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh you can't get to heaven, In a fancy car
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven, In a fancy -- caaaar
<br>Oh you can't get to heaven in a fancy car
<br>'Cause a fancy car can't go that far,
<br>All my sins are washed away, I've been redeemed!
