<h1>On Christ the Solid Rock (key of Bbm)</h1>

<p><i>Bbm</i>My hope is built on <i>Fm</i>nothing <i>Bbm Fm</i>less
<p><i>Bbm</i>Than Jesus blood and <i>Fm</i>righteous<i>Bbm Fm</i>ness;
<p><i>F#</i>I dare not <i>G#</i>trust the sweetest <i>Bbm</i>frame,
<p><i>F#</i>But wholly <i>G#</i>lean on Jesus' <i>Bbm</i>Name.
          
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>REFRAIN:</b>
<p><i>F#</i>On Christ, the <i>G#</i>solid Rock, I <i>Bbm</i>stand;
<p><i>G#</i>All other ground is sinking <i>Bbm</i>sand.
          
<p>&nbsp;
<p>When darkness veils His lovely face,
<br>I rest on His unchanging grace;
<br>In every high and stormy gale
<br>My anchor holds within the veil.

<p>His oath, His covenant, his blood
<br>Support me in the whelming flood;
<br>When all around my soul gives way,
<br>He then is all my Hope and Stay.

<p>When He shall come with trumpet sound
<br>O may I then in Him be found
<br>Clothed in His righteousness alone,
<br>Faultless to stand before the throne!
<p>
