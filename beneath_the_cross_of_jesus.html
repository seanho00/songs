Beneath the Cross of Jesus 
</a></h1>

<p><i>[ capo 4 ]</i>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>Be<i>G</i>neath the <i>(A7/G)</i>cross of <i>G</i>Jesus 
   I <i>D/F#m</i>fain would take my <i>G</i>stand,
<p>The <i>Em</i>shadow of a <i>C2</i>mighty rock
   with<i>Am</i>in a weary <i>B</i>land;
<p>A <i>G</i>home within the wilderness, a <i>C</i>rest upon the <i>Am</i>way,
<p>From the <i>D</i>burning of the <i>G</i>noontide heat,
   and the <i>G</i>burden <i>D</i>of the <i>G</i>day.
</verse>

<verse>
<p>O safe and happy shelter, O refuge tried and sweet,
<br>O trysting place where Heaven's love and Heaven's justice meet!
<br>As to the holy patriarch that wondrous dream was given,
<br>So seems my Savior's cross to me, a ladder up to heav'n.
</verse>

<Verse>
<p>There lies beneath its shadow but on the further side
<br>The darkness of an awful grave that gapes both deep and wide
<br>And there between us stands the cross two arms outstretched to save
<br>A watchman set to guard the way from that eternal grave.
</verse>

<verse>
<p>Upon that cross of Jesus mine eye at times can see
<br>The very dying form of One Who suffered there for me;
<br>And from my stricken heart with tears two wonders I confess;
<br>The wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness.
</verse>

<verse>
<p>I take, O cross, thy shadow for my abiding place;
<br>I ask no other sunshine than the sunshine of His face;
<br>Content to let the world go by to know no gain or loss,
<br>My sinful self my only shame, my glory all the cross.
</verse>
