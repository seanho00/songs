<h1><a href="http://songs.seanho.com/it_is_well_with_my_soul.html">
It Is Well With My Soul 
</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
<p>When sorrows like sea billows roll;
<p>Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
<p>It is well, it is well, with my soul!
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p>It is well (it is well),
   with my soul (with my soul)
<p>It is well, it is well, with my soul!
</blockquote></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
<br>Let this blest assurance control,
<br>That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
<br>And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
<br>My sin, not in part but the whole,
<br>Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
<br>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
<br>The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
<br>The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
<br>Even so, it is well with my soul.
</div>
