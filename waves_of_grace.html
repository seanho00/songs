<h1>Waves of Grace </h1>

<p><i>D</i>The walls are <i>A</i>high, <i>G</i>the walls are strong
<p><i>D</i>I've been locked in this <i>A</i>castle
   that I've <i>Em</i>built for far too <i>G</i>long
<p><i>D</i>You have sur<i>A</i>rounded me, <i>G</i>a sea on every side
<p><i>D</i>The cracks are <i>A</i>forming 
   and I've <i>Em</i>got nowhere to <i>G</i>hide

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>D</i>Now I <i>A</i>see <em>(now I <i>Em</i>see)</em>,
<p>The walls I've built are <i>G</i>falling
<p>And Your <i>D</i>waves of grace are 
   <i>A/C#</i>washing over <i>Em/B</i>me <i>G</i><em>(ohhh)</em>
<p><i>D</i>Now I <i>A</i>see <em>(now I <i>Em</i>see)</em>,
<p>The walls I've built are <i>G</i>falling
<p>And Your <i>D</i>waves of grace are 
   <i>A/C#</i>washing over <i>Em/B</i>me <i>G</i>
</blockquote>

<p>My heart's been hard, I have been blind
<br>I have often worked so hard to keep You from my mind
<br>I have ruled my life, in a palace built on sand
<br>I want you to reign, Lord, take me by the hand

<p>Lord please reign in every part
<br>I give my life to You, I open up my heart
<br>I want to be like You, I want to seek Your face
<br>O Lord please wash me in Your awesome waves of grace
