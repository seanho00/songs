<h1><a href="http://songs.seanho.com/how_great_is_our_god.html">How Great Is Our God 
</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty
<p>Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
<p>He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide
<p>And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p>How great is our God, sing with me
<p>How great is our God, and all will see
<p>How great, how great is our God
</blockquote></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands
<p>Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
<p>The Godhead, Three in One, Father, Spirit, Son
<p>The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="bridge"><blockquote>
<p>Name above all names, Worthy of our praise
<p>My heart will sing, How great is our God
</blockquote></div>
