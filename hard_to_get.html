<h1>Hard To Get</h1>

<p>&nbsp;
<p>You who live in heaven -- hear the prayers of those of us who live on earth
<br>Who are afraid of being left by those we love, and
<br>Who get hardened in the hurt
<br>Do you remember when you lived down here where we all scrape
<br>To find the faith to ask for daily bread
<br>Did you forget about us after you had flown away
<br>Well I memorized every word you said
<br>Still I'm so scared I'm holding my breath
<br>While you're up there just playing hard to get

<p>You who live in radiance -- hear the prayers of those of us who live in skin
<br>We have a love that's not as patient as your was
<br>But still we do love now and then
<br>Did you ever know loneliness -- did you ever know need
<br>Do you remember just how long a night can get
<br>When you are barely holding on and your friends fall asleep
<br>And don't see the blood that's running in your sweat
<br>Will those who mourn be left uncomforted
<br>While you're up there just playing hard to get

<p>I know you bore our sorrows
<br>I know you feel our pain
<br>I know that it would not hurt any less
<br>Even if it could be explained
<br>I know that I am only lashing out at the one who loves me most
<br>And after I have figured this somehow, all I really need to know is if

<p>You who live in eternity  hear the prayers of those of us who live in time
<br>We can't see what's ahead and we cannot get free of what we've left behind
<br>I'm reeling from these voices that keep screaming in my ears
<br>All these words of shame and doubt, blame and regret
<br>I can't see how you're leading me, unless you've led me here
<br>To where I'm lost enough to let myself be led
<br>And so, you've been here all along I guess
<br>It's just your ways and you are just plain hard to get
