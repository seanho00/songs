<h1>So You Would Come</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>D</i>Before the world began, <i>G</i>you were <i>A</i>on His <i>D</i>mind
<p>And <i>G</i>every tear you <i>F#m7</i>cry, is <i>E7</i>precious in His <i>A</i>eyes
<p>Be<i>G</i>cause of His great <i>A</i>love, He <i>F#m7</i>gave His only <i>Bm7</i>Son
<p><i>Em7</i>Everything was <i>A</i>done, so you would <i>D</i>come

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>D</i>Nothing you can do, could <i>G</i>make Him <i>A</i>love you <i>D</i>more
<p>And <i>G</i>nothing that you've <i>F#m7</i>done, could <i>E7</i>make Him close the <i>A</i>door
<p>Be<i>G</i>cause of His great <i>A</i>love, He <i>F#m7</i>gave His only <i>Bm7</i>Son
<p><i>Em7</i>Everything was <i>A</i>done, so you would <i>D</i>come

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come to the <i>G</i>Father, <i>F#m7</i>though your gift is <i>Bm7</i>small
<p><i>G</i>Broken hearts, <i>F#m7</i>broken lives, <i>E7</i>He will take them <i>A</i>all
<p>The <i>G</i>power of the Word, the <i>F#m7</i>power of His <i>Bm7</i>blood
<p><i>Em7</i>Everything was <i>A</i>done, so you would <i>D</i>come
