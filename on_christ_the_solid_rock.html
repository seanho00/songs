<h1>On Christ the Solid Rock</h1>

<p><i>Am</i>My hope is built on <i>Em</i>nothing less <i>Am Em</i>
<p><i>Am</i>Than Jesus blood and <i>Em</i>righteousness; <i>Am Em</i>
<p><i>F</i>I dare not <i>G</i>trust the sweetest <i>Am</i>frame,
<p><i>F</i>But wholly <i>G</i>lean on Jesus' <i>Am</i>Name.
          
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>REFRAIN:</b>
<p><i>F</i>On Christ, the <i>G</i>solid Rock, I <i>Am</i>stand;
<p><i>G</i>All other ground is sinking <i>Am</i>sand.
          
<p>&nbsp;
<p>When darkness veils His lovely face,
<br>I rest on His unchanging grace;
<br>In every high and stormy gale
<br>My anchor holds within the veil.

<p>His oath, His covenant, his blood
<br>Support me in the whelming flood;
<br>When all around my soul gives way,
<br>He then is all my Hope and Stay.

<p>When He shall come with trumpet sound
<br>O may I then in Him be found
<br>Clothed in His righteousness alone,
<br>Faultless to stand before the throne!
<p>
