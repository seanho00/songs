<p><i>[ capo 5 ]</i>&nbsp;</p>

<verse>
<p><i>G</i>Crown Him with <i>G/Em</i>many <i>C</i>crowns,
   the <i>G/B</i>Lamb u<i>C</i>pon His <i>D</i>throne;
<p>Hark <i>G</i>how the <i>Em</i>heav'nly <i>A</i>anthem <i>D</i>drowns,
   all <i>G/D</i>music <i>Asus</i>but its <i>D</i>own!
<p>A<i>G/B</i>wake my soul and <i>C</i>sing,
   of <i>A/C#</i>Him who died for <i>D</i>thee,
<p>And <i>G/B</i>hail Him <i>C</i>as thy <i>Am</i>matchless <i>G</i>King
   through <i>C</i>all e<i>D</i>terni<i>G</i>ty.

<verse>
<p>Crown Him the Lord of love; behold His hands and side,
<br>Those wounds yet visible above, in beauty glorified:
<br>No angel in the sky can fully bear that sight,
<br>But downward bends His burning eye at mysteries so bright.
</verse>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>Crown Him the Lord of peace, whose power a sceptre sways,
<br>From pole to pole, that wars may cease, and all be prayer and praise:
<br>His reign shall know no end, and round His pierced feet,
<br>Fair flowers of paradise extend, their fragrance ever sweet.
</verse>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<verse>
<p>Crown Him the Lord of years, the Potentate of time,
<br>Creator of the rolling spheres, ineffably sublime!
<br>All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me;
<br>Thy praise shall never, never fail throughout eternity.
</verse>
