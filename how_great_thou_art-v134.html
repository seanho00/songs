How Great Thou Art 
</a></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p> O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder
<p> Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
<p> I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
<p> Thy power throughout the universe displayed:
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="chorus"><blockquote>
<p> Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
<p> How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
<p> Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
<p> How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
</blockquote></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p> And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
<br>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
<br>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
<br>He bled and died to take away my sin:
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p> When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
<br>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
<br>Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
<br>And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
</div>
