<h1>My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less (key of Db)</h1>

<p>My <i>Db</i>hope is built on <i>Ab/C</i>nothing less
<p>Than <i>Gb/Bb</i>Jesus blood and <i>Ab/C</i>righteous<i>Db</i>ness;
<p>I <i>Db</i>dare not trust the <i>Ab/C</i>sweetest frame,
<p>But <i>Gb/Bb</i>wholly lean on <i>Ab/C</i>Jesus' <i>Db</i>Name.
<i>(1/4 rest)</i>
          
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<chorus><blockquote>
<p>On <i>Db</i>Christ, the solid <i>Gb</i>Rock, I stand;
<p>All <i>Db/F</i>other ground is <i>Db/F</i>sinking <i>Ab</i>sand,
<p>All <i>Gb/Bb</i>other ground is <i>Ab/C</i>sinking <i>Db</i>sand.
</blockquote></chorus>
          
<p>&nbsp;
<p>When darkness veils His lovely face,
<br>I rest on His unchanging grace;
<br>In every high and stormy gale
<br>My anchor holds within the veil.

<p>His oath, His covenant, his blood
<br>Support me in the whelming flood;
<br>When all around my soul gives way,
<br>He then is all my Hope and Stay.

<p>When He shall come with trumpet sound
<br>O may I then in Him be found
<br>Clothed in His righteousness alone,
<br>Faultless to stand before the throne!
<p>
