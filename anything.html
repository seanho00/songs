<p>I can't do anything,
I can't do anything without You
<br>But You can do everything,
You can do everything You want
<br>I just can't believe,
I just can't believe that You would love me
<br>After everything,
After everything I've done

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want to <i>Dm</i>love You,
Love You <i>C</i>more than life itself
<p>And I want to <i>F</i>hold You,
Even <i>C</i>though You can't be held
<p>Because You're <i>Am</i>so much more,
Than any<i>D</i>thing I've ever known
<p>Any<i>Fm</i>thing, any<i>C</i>thing

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd give anything,
I would give anything to hold You
<br>I want to live for You,
For You alone I want to live
<br>When I see Your face,
I would do anything to know You
<br>You gave everything,
You gave all You have to give

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hal<i>C</i>le, hallelujah,
   Hal<i>F</i>le, hallelujah,
<p>Hal<i>Dm</i>le, hal<i>F</i>lelujah,
   Halle<i>C</i>
