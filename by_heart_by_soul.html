<h1>By Heart, By Soul</h1>
<small>capo 1 (CD in key of Ab to A)</small>

<p>If <i>G</i>you were a <i>D/F#</i>road,
<p>I'd <i>Em</i>learn every <i>D</i>turn til <i>C</i>I
<p>Could <i>C</i>find my way with <i>Em</i>my eyes <i>D</i>closed
<p>If <i>G</i>you were a <i>D/F#</i>song,
<p><i>Em</i>I'd sing a<i>D</i>long til <i>C</i>I
<p>Knew <i>C</i>every word and <i>Em</i>every <i>D</i>note
<p>But <i>Cm</i>you are everything to me, a <i>Em</i>mystery
<p><i>Eb?</i>You're the love I live to <i>D</i>see

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By <i>G</i>heart, by <i>D/F#</i>soul
<p>That's <i>Em</i>how I want to <i>D</i>know you
<p><i>C</i>Keep you as <i>G/B</i>close as <i>Am</i>breath is to <i>D</i>life
<p>Wanna <i>G</i>watch your <i>D/F#</i>love un<i>Em</i>fold
<p>By <i>Am</i>heart <i>D</i>(by heart), by <i>G</i>soul

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were a place,
<br>I'd stay my whole life, so I
<br>Had every corner memorized
<br>And if you were a star, 
<br>I'd follow you home, you would  be
<br>The light that is my only guide
<br>You are everything to me, my A to Z
<br>And will be forever, in eternity

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Cm</i>I want to know you, <i>G</i>inside and out
<p><i>Cm</i>Better than I even know my<i>D</i>self
