<h1>God Is So Wonderful</h1>

<!-- key: G -->

<p>God is so wonderful,
<br>I can't explain;
<br>But I can say, "Glory, Hallelujah,
<br>Praise His holy Name!"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's wonderful because He saved me,
<br>It's wonderful that He forgave me,
<br>It's wonderful, wonderful, so very wonderful,
<br>Wonderful that He is mine.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cast on Him my every burden,
<br>Lay at His feet my every care,
<br>It's wonderful, wonderful, so very wonderful,
<br>Wonderful that He is mine.
